// Tables for each of the year types.  XX indicates that it is a Holiday, and
// a special parsha is read that week.  For some year types, Israel is different
// than the diaspora.
//
// The names indicate the day of the week on which Rosh Hashanah fell, whether
// it is a short/normal/long year (kvia=0,1,2), and whether it is a leap year.
// Some year types also have an _Israel version.
//
// Numbers are indices into the table above for a given week.  Numbers > 100 indicate
// a double parsha.  E.g. 150 means read both table entries 50 and 51.
//
// These tables were stolen (with some massaging) from the GNU code.
