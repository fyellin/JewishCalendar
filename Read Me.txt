Requirements
A Macintosh running Mac OS 8.6 or later with CarbonLib at least v1.3, or Mac OS X.

Version History
Version 2.1 (24 September 2000)
Carbonized it (fizzzzzzzzzz....)

Version 2.1.1 (27 December 2001)
Small arrows in year picker dialog now work properly under Mac OS X
New icon (thanks to Jomy Muttathil)
Adjustment to Yom HaShoah date calculation (thanks to Ben Stitz)
Minor tweaks here and there

Version 2.1.2 (16 April 2002)
Remembers menu settings (Diaspora/Israel, Gregorian/Julian, etc.) and page setup
Uses sheets for printing UI

Kudos
Jomy Muttathil for the icon
Ben Stitz for the information about Yom HaShoah date calculations (as of 1997, if Yom HaShoah falls on a Sunday, it's bumped to the following Monday so that organizers don't have to work on Saturday to prepare)
